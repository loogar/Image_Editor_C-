========================
Features explanation:
========================

Erosion============>This one makes bigger bright zones on the image

Dilation==========>This one makes bigger Darker zones on the image

Resizing========>Good old resizing

Blending======>The lets you Blend two images in to one

Lightning=====>This helps with lighting and darkning of the image
 
All===>Opens every function

Edge Detection==>finds all the edges of the objets on the image, and mark them in white, while getting everything else in black

Shape Detection=>This one is Experimental thing we have to add at the end because Blending is apperently not a “advanced function”.But this one is actually pretty intresting as we computed it to detect 4 shapes it detects shapes in any images its actually pretty cool!!

Special thanks:
